Three neural network classifiers with two hidden layers for binary classification has been built: 

1. One making the prediction based on the first two features
2. Another one predicting based on the first three features
3. A classifier based on four features. 


The data used is the banknote authentication data set. There is a total of four features with 1372 examples, each example representing a banknote.
